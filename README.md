# Populus
This is a **work in progress** NPC plugin for advanced control over the behaviour of NPCs.

> [!CAUTION]
> Currently, the plugin **does not work**. It is still heavily in development and should not be used.

## Planned features
- [ ] Static NPCs.
- [ ] Hitting NPCs triggering commands/events in hooked plugins like DeluxeMenus GUI.
- [ ] Path definition + finding for NPCs. Make them move around!
- [ ] Advanced scriptability of behavioural traits.
- [ ] Same for not only Player NPCs, but also other entities (like pigs or similar).

## Support
Populus only develops for the latest Paper version available. Any versions published before will not be supported.
For support questions, you can ask in our Discord: (NOT YET AVAILABLE)

## Downloads
You can download the prebuild plugin in any of these sources:

## Building
In order to build the plugin, just clone it via `git clone https://github.com/Strokkur424/Populus.git`, `cd Populus`, and then run `./gradlew build`.
On windows, you will have to replace the slash `/` with a backslash `\`.
